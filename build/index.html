<h2>CloudShelf: 5 Reasons Why</h2>

<h3>1# Encouraging reading is most successful when the progress is tracked.</h3>

<p>With endless distractions on our phones and devices, much of our screen time can be unproductive. CloudShelf can help track reading progress, building a sense of accomplishment by reviewing the Books Read and Reading shelves. Reading goals are simply set by adding cooks to the want to read shelf. As any effective leader, parent or teacher knows, measure the area you want to see change! </p>

<h3> <bold>#2 CloudShelf unites your library of real and ebooks from every platform.</bold> </h3>
<p>Purchasing or borrowing books have habitually changed, in 2022  76% of American households have Amazon accounts, virtual libraries are a common feature on every mobile device, and even community libraries offer electronic books. Consequently, readers have a marriott of real and virtual books, often from various apps.</p>

<p>CloudShelf allows the readers to track books from all of their personal libraries and their electronic reading platforms together. </p>
<h3>#3 CloudShelf is the missing librarian in your book search.</h3>
<p>Use CloudShelf as a virtual librarian to encourage reading. In a UK survey of kids between 8 and 16, nearly half (48%) reported not making use of public libraries. The most common reason given was they didn’t have interesting material (Steatfield et al. 2010). The survey also found that public library users were twice as likely to read outside of school, and report more reading enjoyment.</p>

<p>CloudShelf attempts to bridge the gap and help readers find interesting books. Children and adults have unlimited ability to search for titles and authors of interest, despite using an online library, online commerce or the local library. </p>
 
<h3>#4 Use CloudShelf to make screen time more productive.</h3>

<p>With so many distractions competing for our attention, instead of endless social media scrolling, or mind numbing games use CloudShelf and your favorite library app together. Easily search and add books to your CloudShelf bookshelves, before adding them to your electronic reader or neighborhood library.</p>

<h3>#5 Use CloudShelf to encourage reading and releive stress.</h3>

<p>Reading for pleasure has been associated with higher wellness levels. Reading for pleasure has a higher correlation with test scores in children than socio-economic status. Reading for pleasure is associated with better mental health (Clark and Teravainen-Gof, 2017).</p>

<p>CloudShelf can help promote reading for pleasure, by finding books of interest and promoting consistent reading for pleasure habits. </p>
