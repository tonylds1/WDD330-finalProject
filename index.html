      <h2>CloudShelf: 5 Reasons Why</h2>

      <h3>
        1# Encouraging reading is most successful when the progress is tracked.
      </h3>

      <p>
        With endless distractions on our phones and devices, much of our screen
        time can be unproductive. CloudShelf can help track reading progress,
        building a sense of accomplishment by reviewing the Books Read and
        Reading shelves. Reading goals are simply set by adding cooks to the
        want to read shelf. As any effective leader, parent or teacher knows,
        measure the area you want to see change!
      </p>

      <h3>
        <bold>#2 CloudShelf unites your library of real and ebooks from every
          platform.</bold>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Purchasing or borrowing books have habitually changed, in 2022 76% of
        American households have Amazon accounts, virtual libraries are a common
        feature on every mobile device, and even community libraries offer
        electronic books. Consequently, readers have a marriott of real and
        virtual books, often from various apps.
      </p>

      <p>
        CloudShelf allows the readers to track books from all of their personal
        libraries and their electronic reading platforms together.
      </p>
      <h3>#3 CloudShelf is the missing librarian in your book search.</h3>
      <p>
        Use CloudShelf as a virtual librarian to encourage reading. In a UK
        survey of kids between 8 and 16, nearly half (48%) reported not making
        use of public libraries. The most common reason given was they didn’t
        have interesting material (Steatfield et al. 2010). The survey also
        found that public library users were twice as likely to read outside of
        school, and report more reading enjoyment.
      </p>
      <img class="fit-picture" src="./images/contentimages/student.png" alt="teen on computer.">
      <p>
        CloudShelf attempts to bridge the gap and help readers find interesting
        books. Children and adults have unlimited ability to search for titles
        and authors of interest, despite using an online library, online
        commerce or the local library.
      </p>

      <h3>#4 Use CloudShelf to make screen time more productive.</h3>

      <p>
        With so many distractions competing for our attention, instead of
        endless social media scrolling, or mind numbing games use CloudShelf and
        your favorite library app together. Easily search and add books to your
        CloudShelf bookshelves, before adding them to your electronic reader or
        neighborhood library.
      </p>

      <h3>#5 Use CloudShelf to encourage reading and releive stress.</h3>

      <p>
        Reading for pleasure has been associated with higher wellness levels.
        Reading for pleasure has a higher correlation with test scores in
        children than socio-economic status. Reading for pleasure is associated
        with better mental health (Clark and Teravainen-Gof, 2017).
      </p>

      <p>
        CloudShelf can help promote reading for pleasure, by finding books of
        interest and promoting consistent reading for pleasure habits.
